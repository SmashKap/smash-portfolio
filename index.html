                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My name is Ashley, but my family and friends call me “Smash.”  I am a proud nerd and problem-solver.  I was raised on a farm in central Missouri, but I currently live in Little Rock, Arkansas, with my husband and my beloved canine pal.  My interest in tech and coding began during my Animal Science graduate program.  The first time I saw an Excel Pivot Table in action, I was hooked!  From there, I immersed myself in all things Excel, and my friends and co-workers soon referred to me as their resident “Excel Queen.”  </p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My journey into coding continued when I became the project manager of a software upgrade for a multi-state land title company.  Once again, I dove headfirst into learning all that I could about the software, which ultimately led to my first experiences with true "coding."  After this, I realized that focusing on a career in tech would allow me to combine my nerdiness and love of coding with my passion for helping people solve problems and simplify processes.  I can’t wait to see what is in store for me next!</p>
